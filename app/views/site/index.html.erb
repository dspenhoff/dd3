  <p>Why a duck?</p>
  <p>A "duck" is a stack of stones guiding hikers on a hard to find trail. Similarly, Deal<span class="duck-span">duck</span> guides sales executives to make better forecasts, with less risk of missing.</p>
  <p>Sales executives are good at understanding and managing the uncertainties and risks of individual deals. However, when a sales pipeline includes dozens or hundreds of deals it is nearly impossible to quantify and manage the total risk of meeting or missing a forecast.</p><p>Until now. </p>
  <p>Deal<span class="duck-span">duck</span> performs in-depth analysis and gives valuable insights about the total risk in a forecast by "crunching the numbers" across all deals in the sales pipeline.
  <p>How good is your forecast? Would you like to know?</p>
