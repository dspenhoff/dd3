  	<h3>Welcome to Dealduck Sales Forecast+Risk Analytics</h3>
  	
  	<p><span style="font-style:italic; color:#ff0000;">This is a development prototype and is likely to change frequently.</span></p>

  	<p>Dealduck Sales Forecast+Risk Analytics is a unique tool that gives you valuable insight about the risk in your sales forecast. Not the risk about specific deals but instead the aggregate of deals that comprise your forecast.</p>
  	<p>Sales managers are good at understanding the factors that impact the uncertainty of an individual deal. However, when your sales forecast is made up of dozens or hundreds of deals, it is hard to quantify the total, aggregate risk. For example, if your objective is to make a forecast that you have at least a 90% likelihood of achieving, what should that forecast be? How good is any given forecast?</p>
  	
  	<p>Thatâ€™s where Deal Pipeline Analytics+Risk Analysis helps, by applying modeling and risk analysis techniques to your sales pipeline data.</p>

  	<ul>
  		<li>Capture the details about individual deal risks so they can be consistently analyzed as part of your total, aggregate sales forecast</li>
  		<li>Analyze your sales forecast under different assumptions</li>
  		<li>Analyze your aggregate sales forecast risk based on simulating alternate scenarios</li>
  		<li>Gain insight about your "revenue at risk" and other measures of the quality of your forecast so you can take appropriate actions
  	</ul>
