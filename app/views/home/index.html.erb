  	<p>Dealduck Sales Forecast+Risk Analytics performs in-depth analysis and gives you valuable insights about the total risk in your sales forecast by "crunching the numbers" across all the deals in your pipeline. Dealduck tells you the risk in the aggregate of all deals that are in your forecast.</p>
  	<p>Sales executives are good at understanding and managing the uncertainties and risks of individual deals. However, when your pipeline includes dozens or hundreds of deals it is hard to quantify and manage the total risk. For example, if your business objective is to make a forecast that you have at least a 90% likelihood of achieving, what should that forecast be? How good is any given forecast?</p>
  	<p>Thatâ€™s where Dealduck Sales Forecast+Risk Analytics helps. Dealduck applies sophisticated, quantitative modeling and risk analysis techniques to your sales pipeline data.</p>
  	<p>How good is your forecast? What would you do if you knew?
